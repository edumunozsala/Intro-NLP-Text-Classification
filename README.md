# Introduction to Natural Language Processing: Text Classification on tweets

This repository contains a compilation of notebooks introducing some relevants topics and concepts to get started in Natural Language Processing. 

This concepts are applyed to a text classification task from a Kaggle compettion. It is only for demo purposes we are not tring to builds a fine tuned classifier that beats others competitors
This is a [Kaggle Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/nlp-getting-started)


## Problem description

Twitter has become an important communication channel in times of emergency.

The ubiquitousness of smartphones enables people to announce an emergency they’re observing in real-time. Because of this, more agencies are interested in programatically monitoring Twitter (i.e. disaster relief organizations and news agencies). In this competition, you’re challenged to build a machine learning model that predicts which Tweets are about real disasters and which one’s aren’t. You’ll have access to a dataset of 10,000 tweets that were hand classified. If this is your first time working on an NLP problem, we've created a quick tutorial to get you up and running.
