    "## Word embeddings\n",
    "\n",
    "**What is word embedding?**\n",
    "Word embeddings are a type of word representation that allows words with similar meaning to have a similar representation. They are a distributed representation for text that is perhaps one of the key breakthroughs for the impressive performance of deep learning methods on challenging natural language processing problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Word embeddings are in fact a class of techniques where individual words are represented as real-valued vectors in a predefined vector space. Each word is mapped to one vector and the vector values are learned in a way that resembles a neural network, and hence the technique is often lumped into the field of deep learning. The distributed representation is learned based on the usage of words. This allows words that are used in similar ways to result in having similar representations, naturally capturing their meaning. \n",
    "\n",
    "**How can we obtain the word embedings?**\n",
    "1. **Embedding Layer**\n",
    "\n",
    "An embedding layer is a word embedding that is learned in a neural network model on a specific natural language processing task. The documents or corpus of the task are cleaned and prepared and the size of the vector space is specified as part of the model, such as 50, 100, or 300 dimensions. The vectors are initialized with small random numbers. The embedding layer is used on the front end of a neural network and is fit in a supervised way using the Backpropagation algorithm. \n",
    "\n",
    "It is a flexible layer that can be used in a variety of ways, such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "- It can be used alone to learn a word embedding that can be saved and used in another model later.\n",
    "- It can be used as part of a deep learning model where the embedding is learned along with the model itself.\n",
    "- It can be used to load a pre-trained word embedding model, a type of transfer learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach requires a lot of training data and can be very slow, but will learn an embedding both targeted to the specific text data and the NLP task we are interested.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Word2Vec**\n",
    "\n",
    "Word2Vec is a statistical method for efficiently learning a standalone word embedding from a text corpus. It was developed by Tomas Mikolov, et al. at Google in 2013 as a response to make the neural-network-based training of the embedding more efficient and since then has become the de facto standard for developing pre-trained word embedding.\n",
    "\n",
    "It learns the word embedding in one of two ways, either using context to predict a target word (a method known as continuous bag of words, or CBOW), or using a word to predict a target context, which is called skip-gram, for example, we’d like to predict c context words having one target word on the input. The latter method usually produces more accurate results on large datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "![CBOW model](images/CBOW.png \"CBOW Model\")\n",
    "\n",
    "A well trained set of word vectors will place similar words close to each other in that space. The words oak, elm and birch might cluster in one corner, while war, conflict and strife huddle together in another.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Glove**\n",
    "\n",
    "The Global Vectors for Word Representation, or GloVe, algorithm is an extension to the word2vec method for efficiently learning word vectors, developed by Pennington, et al. at Stanford. GloVe is an unsupervised learning algorithm for obtaining vector representations for words. Training is performed on aggregated global word-word co-occurrence statistics from a corpus, and the resulting representations showcase interesting linear substructures of the word vector space.\n",
    "\n",
    "GloVe is an approach to marry both the global statistics of matrix factorization techniques like LSA (Latent Semantic Analysis) with the local context-based learning in word2vec. Rather than using a window to define local context, GloVe constructs an explicit word-context or word co-occurrence matrix using statistics across the whole text corpus.\n",

    "Jeffrey Pennington, Richard Socher, and Christopher D. Manning. 2014. GloVe: Global Vectors for Word Representation. \n",
    "https://nlp.stanford.edu/pubs/glove.pdf\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Fasttext** \n",
    "\n",
    "The FastText model takes into account internal structure of words by splitting them into a bag of character n-grams and adding to them a whole word as a final feature. If we denote n-gram vector as z and v as output vector representation of word w (context word):\n",
    "\n",
    "$$s(w,c)=\\sum_{g\\in G_w}z^T_gv_c$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We can choose n-grams of any size, but in practice size from 3 to 6 is the most suitable one\n",
